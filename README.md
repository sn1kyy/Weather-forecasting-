# Weather Forecasting Project

A machine learning-based weather forecasting project developed and demonstrated on Google Colab.

### A quick note (please read ong)
I will be working on the user interface (yes using django) of this project - although not now but shortly in the future.

## Project Description

This project uses historical weather data and machine learning techniques to predict future weather conditions. The interactive Google Colab notebook walks users through data loading, preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, and evaluation. The workflow is fully reproducible and can be adapted for other datasets or forecasting tasks.

### Access the Colab Notebook 

[**Open the Colab Notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Ij2_i3tCcEMeaGUGUvqsIc-0qrcBGmZX#scrollTo=s8rgzMirJNVG)

### Dataset

The project utilizes a public weather dataset. Download or access it here:

## How to Use


1. **Open the Colab notebook** using the link above.
2. **Upload the dataset** as described in the notebook instructions.
3. **Run each cell** to follow the data analysis, model building, and forecasting steps.


## Dependencies

All required Python libraries are installed automatically in the Colab notebook, including:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib / seaborn
- scikit-learn

## Features

- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis and visualization
- Machine learning model training and evaluation
- Interactive, reproducible workflow in Google Colab
